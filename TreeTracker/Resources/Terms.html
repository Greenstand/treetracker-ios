<h1>Greenstand - Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>How We Handle Data:</h2>

<p>
Our primary goals are to use data to create a greener earth and offer an option for economic opportunity in areas of extreme poverty. We
believe that the scientific and project related data we collect (that is not private by nature) should be freely available to the
public. Unless otherwise authorized we will not disclose sensitive user information, such as contact information. Our primary data
collection is focused around scientific research and creating a transparent system to collect field data related to the survival
processes of trees as well as any information related to the systematic harvesting of tree related products. This information includes
planter geo-tagged, time-stamped photos and other user entered data.
</p>

websites. User’s first name and/or organization name may be displayed with the corresponding tree data. With prior consent, other user
related information may be displayed. Upon request all user data may be hidden from public view. Phone numbers and/or email addresses may
be used by GreenStand to contact planters, but will not be shared with third parties without prior consent.
